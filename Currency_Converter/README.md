# Currency Converter

## Description

This is one of my very first projects, created as an exercise in programming with C. The program is a simple currency converter that allows users to convert amounts from Euros to other currencies including US Dollars, Russian Rubles, British Pounds, and Chinese Yuan.

## Features

- Converts Euros to:
  - US Dollars
  - Russian Rubles
  - British Pounds
  - Chinese Yuan
- Prompts user for the amount in Euros and the target currency.
- Handles invalid input gracefully, asking the user to try again.
- Allows the user to perform multiple conversions in one session.

## Usage

1. **Compile the Program:**

   Use a C compiler to compile the program. For example, using `gcc`:

   ```bash
   gcc -o Currency_Converter currency_converter.c
